# Migration of an application to a new openshift cluster

Constains how-tos and scripts for the migrations of an application in a namespace of an Openshift cluster.

## Backup all relevant resources of an appplication in a namespace
If resources where created in the old cluster via the Openshift UI and not saved in yaml files then all theses resources have to be downloaded as yaml files.

The following script: [save_namespace_quota_to_yaml.sh](./scripts/save_namespace_quota_to_yaml.sh) save the namespace and the quota associated with it.
It requires the cli oc and a succesful login to the Openshift cluster and as parameters the namespace and optional the backup dir

The following script: [save_all_resources_to_yaml.sh](./scripts/save_all_resources_to_yaml.sh) save all relevant resources from that namespace.
It requires the cli oc and a succesful login to the Openshift cluster and as parameters the namespace and optional the backup dir

These resource yaml files contain additional fields and metadata dynamically generated by Openshift during deployment.
These can be removed and are not necessary for the new cluster.
The following script [clean_openshift_yaml](./scripts/clean_openshift_yaml.sh) can be used for the clean up.
It requires the cli oc and a succesful login to the Openshift cluster, thw yq tool and as parameters the namespace and optional the backup dir
